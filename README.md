# Implement Train Reservation System using DS
## Problem Statement
Write a program in Python/C++ to implement a Railway Reservation system which should contain the following operations - 
1. Insert 
2. Display
3. Search
4. Fares
5. Book Tickets 
6. Cancel Ticket

## 2. Introduction
The railway reservation system facilitates the passengers to enquire about the trains
available on the basis of source and destination, booking and of tickets, enquire about the
status of the booked ticket, etc. The aim of this project is to create a Railway Reservation
System with the use of Linked List. Using the basic operations of Linked List, the project has
been implemented using C++ language. The reservation records include the train ID, name,
source, destination, travelling details such as Day, Month and Year of the journey, number
of coaches available and seats booked.

## 3. Requirements
### 3.1 Software
- C++ Compiler (MinGW 64 bit)
- CLion - Cross Platform IDE for C and C++

### 3.2 Hardware
- OS : Windows 64/32 bit
- Ubuntu 20.x

## 4 Library/Package
- Except the default C++ libraries, no other special or third party libraries were used.

## 4. Conclusion
The given problem statement is solved. A train reservation system has been created in C++
using one of the fundamental data structures, the linked list. Operations like adding of
trains and booking of trains can be done using the project.
